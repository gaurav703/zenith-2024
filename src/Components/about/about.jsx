          Zenith is state level sports extravaganza of our college started in 2016. As we know, sports improve our confidence, health and it illuminates team spirit, let’s dive into it and explore the enthusiasm of this event.
The tagline of something gives short but deep insight of what we are getting out of it. So this year Zenith comes with the tagline “A Celebration of Eternal Glory.” Eternal means existing forever and we are celebrating the pride means glory which lasts forever through sports.
After successful completion of 8 editions we are back with its 9th edition.
